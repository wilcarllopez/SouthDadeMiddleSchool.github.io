I-PREP
iPrep Math was born from the vision of providing immediate access to a 21st century learning environment in the critical content area of mathematics to the maximum number of students possible. iPrep Math represents a significant departure from the traditional methods of mathematics instruction in M-DCPS to one that is more aligned with the goals of the new Florida Standards and that will provide students with a foundation and experiences, such as independence, decision-making, collaboration, persistence-on-task, and self-pacing that are relevant to the 21stcentury work environment
