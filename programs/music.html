South Dade Middle School is proud to announce the return of Band and Orchestra, under the direction of Ms. Nicole Vasconcelos.  South Dade currently has two String Orchestras, three Wind Bands, and a full Drum line on its way! Students will not only learn how to play their instruments, but how to work together in a community with music at its core. All Middle school grade levels are welcome to join.
